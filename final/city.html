            <h3>Then...</h3>
            <p>The Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1907 by John H. Patterson, the man behind one of Dayton’s best known businesses, the National Cash Register Company. Patterson saw the need for a chamber of commerce to give area businesses a central, unified voice. He brought together the business leaders of his time and set forth a course that would soon create real change for the Dayton region.</p>

            <h3>...Now</h3>
            <p>Many of the chamber’s early years were spent looking for ways to improve the Dayton region to benefit member businesses, but as time went on, the chamber began to also create avenues for member businesses to give back to the community.<br>
            Each year, more than one hundred young professionals volunteer their time for area non-profits during the annual Generation Dayton Day. Members say their involvement with Generation Dayton not only opened doors within their careers, but also helped them develop a sense of place and a greater love for the Dayton region.</p>
